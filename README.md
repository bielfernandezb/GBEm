# GBEm
GBEm is a C++ coded Emulator of the Nintendo Game Boy.

## Description
This is a personal project with the scope to learn about hardware and the development of emulators. 

## ATTENTION

I have very little experience in this field at the moment and I'm not sure what approach to take. The project can change direction at any time and does not have a concrete definition. For now it just serves as a way to test ideas and experiment. This project is a simple proof of concept. If you want a top notch experience to enjoy and revive old memories better look for another emulator option. Out there are infinite better options made by top notch developers and way more capable and experienced than me.
